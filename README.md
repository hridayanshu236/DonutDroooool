# Donut Game

Welcome to the Donut Game! This project is a Unity-based game featuring a 3D donut model created in Blender. The game uses C++ for custom logic and Unity for game development.

## Overview

The Donut Game is a 3D physics-based game where players control a donut using the keyboard. The donut model is imported from Blender and is equipped with Rigidbody physics to interact with the environment. Players can move the donut forward, backward, and sideways, and control its balance using torque.

## Key Components

- **Unity:** The primary game development platform used to create and manage the game.
- **Blender:** Used to model and export the 3D donut and its components.
- **C++:** Utilized for custom logic and scripting within the Unity project.
- **C# Scripts:** Handle movement and physics interactions in Unity.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Unity:** Ensure you have Unity installed. Download it from [Unity's official website](https://unity.com/).
- **Blender:** Ensure you have Blender installed for model creation. Download it from [Blender's official website](https://www.blender.org/).
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler if you need to integrate any custom C++ code.
